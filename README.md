## Description

This application is a portfolio shell for my current and future projects and also a way to give employers an easy way to look at both my background and my credentials. This application includes three pages, the first is a home page with my professional information and a little information about myself. The second page is a portfolio page that will show not only a snapshot of projects I have worked on but also a brief description of them and when I last worked on them. Lastly there is a Contact page where an employer could reach out to me. This was my first real experience using bootstraps so some challenges on this project for me were keeping clear semantics while using bootstraps embedded classes and styles and also making this page stylistically appealing. To make the page more my own, I also included an independent CSS file. Overall I am very happy with the way my project came out in appearance. 

## Installation 

While the basic style and shell for this project has been created there are still many things it will need before it is a fully functional application. On the portfolio page there are currently only 2 projects and descriptions, as I have not made many yet. In addition, the Contact page is not currently connected to any messaging service. Both of these things will have to change before the project is ready to be used.

## Usage 

This application is very strait forward, the navigation bar will help the user navigate between the three pages. The only other usable component is the links which are apparent when focused on as they will change color from grey to blue.
